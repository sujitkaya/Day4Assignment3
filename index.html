                <p>
                    Yurnero, the Juggernaut, is a melee agility hero whose abilities allow him to sprint into battle and
                    recklessly devastate enemies in an impenetrable flurry of blades.

                    His abilities grant invulnerability and spell immunity, turning him into an unstoppable force on a
                    hairpin. </p>

                <p>Ostarion, the Wraith King, is a melee strength hero, as well as a carry and tank, capable of both
                    dealing
                    and taking plenty of damage. His infamous Reincarnation allows the Wraith King to rise again after
                    death, acting like an Aegis of the Immortal, making him especially difficult to kill. But if left
                    alive,
                    the Wraith King can wreak havoc upon his enemies;

            <p>Darkterror, the Faceless Void, is a melee agility hero played as an offlaner or carry. Given a little
                time, he becomes a terrifying hero capable of destroying entire enemy teams in seconds.

                Wielding his cosmically powered mace, each blow can lock his foes in time,</p>
